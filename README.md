nbdev-hello-world
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is my personal repo where I’m trying the stuff in [the fastai nbdev
tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html).

``` sh
pip install nbdev_hello_world
```

## How to use

Fill me in please! Don’t forget code examples:

``` python
1+1
```

# First Example

The first example implemented the ‘say_hello’ function in a notebook
that does ‘something’. It also did some ‘unit tests’ on the function in
a few different ways to show an ‘automated’ test.

``` python
say_hello("Isaac")
```
